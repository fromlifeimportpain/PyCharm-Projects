Question 34 - Error correction in reads
https://rosalind.info/problems/corr/
The program has to identify all the reads which are incorrect due to single point mutations, and also find the correct
read from which the incorrect read was derived.
Given: A collection of up to 1000 reads of equal length (at most 50 bp) in FASTA format.
Return: A list of all corrections in the form "[old read]->[new read]". (Each correction must be a single symbol substitution, and you may return the corrections in any order.)

Question 33 - Calculating Catalan Numbers for Secondary Structures
https://rosalind.info/problems/cat/
Given: An RNA string s having the same number of occurrences of 'A' as 'U' and the same number
of occurrences of 'C' as 'G'. The length of the string is at most 300 bp.
Return: The total number of noncrossing perfect matchings of basepair edges in the bonding graph of s,
modulo 1,000,000.

Question 25 - Genome Assembly as Shortest Substring
https://rosalind.info/problems/long/
Given: At most 50 DNA strings of approximately equal length, not exceeding 1 kbp, in FASTA format (which represent reads deriving from the same strand of a single linear chromosome).

The dataset is guaranteed to satisfy the following condition: there exists a unique way to reconstruct the entire chromosome from these reads by gluing together pairs of reads that overlap by more than half their length.

Return: A shortest superstring containing all the given strings (thus corresponding to a reconstructed chromosome).
